# Lemonade

Ratios of making lemonade on The Internet are quite varied.

(in US cups)

| Sugar | Lemon Juice | Water |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1.5   | 1.5         | 8     |
| 2     | 2           | 8     |
| 1     | 2           | 6 + a lot of ice |

The later is from of course [Serious Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/06/classic-lemonade-recipe.html).

The steps are:
* Dissolve sugar in water.  One may need to heat up water to make it dissolve.
* Add in lemon juice
* ICE
