 What we're doing at GitHub because we belive so strongly in the future of developers and in the new develop,er we're looking at the fact that 60,000 computer science majors graduate in the US every year,  but we're anticipating 15 million new jobs, technical jobs in this country. in the next 20 yearas. That math doesn't work. If we think that if we're going to actually see innovation we want in this next generation or the next two generations of software developement, this map doesn't work. I'm not here to trash computer science degree, I'm sure many of you have very lovely science degrees, that'S wondeful. Computer science degrees are one pathway to being oepne source contributors, one pathway. It is not the only pathway. If I took a pull in this reoom today, of how many of you are not computer science majors but are amazing contributors, to open source communities, to really cool innoative technoloy, ....you might be self taughtm you might have gone to a coding school, you might have had that one teacher somewhere in the school, who said you've got the talent you've got the skill. You shuold just do this thing.
