# Rice Cooker Rice

The common rice cooker (especially Japanese ones) come with 
special "cups" to measure the rice, and then you need to add
water until it reaches a certain line.   This is error prone,
and "cup" isn't a USA "cup", so if you lose the cup, you have 
no idea what is going on.

Using grams is the pro-move in all cooking, and this is no exception.
