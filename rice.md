# Rice Cooker Rice

The common rice cooker (especially Japanese ones) come with 
special "cups" to measure the rice, and then you need to add
water until it reaches a certain line.   This is error prone,
and "cup" isn't a USA "cup", so if you lose the cup, you have 
no idea what is going on.

Using grams is the pro-move in all cooking, and this is no exception.

This is the process that minimizes effort and is the most
accurate.

1. Put empty rice bowl on scale, and zero.
2. Add rice to the desired amount.
3. Remove bowl from scale and rinse rice as needed
4. Return bowl to scale and add enough water
   so the total is correct.
5. Cook it.
