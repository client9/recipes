# "Mushrooms Vittoria" or "Steakhouse Mushrooms"

* A mix of Butter and Olive oil, about 1T each: Melt 
* Mix of garlic and/or shallots.
* Add about 1lb of button mushrooms, half if really big
* Saute mushrooms for about 15m until juice is released.
* OPTIONAL: Add 1C white wine, reduce (about 10m)
* Season to taste with salt, pepper, parsley

Since garlic can burn, one other strategy is add 6 cloves garlic but "flattened"
Cook for 30s then remove.
