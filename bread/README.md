# Bread

This is almost 100% based from [Flour Water Salt
Yeast](http://amzn.to/2fhky5U) by [Ken
Forkish](https://www.amazon.com/Ken-Forkish/e/B008DI1O60/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1).

I recommend your buy the book.  These notes are so:

* so the book doesn't get destroyed with goopy
dough bits.
* Convert to make 1 loaf (book does 2)
* Added time measurements
