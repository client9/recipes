# Reconstitued Dried Mushrooms

Works with shitake and porcini

* Add 1C hot water to 1oz diried mushrooms
* Wait 40m
* Remove mushrooms, squeeze out water back into bowl
* Chop mushrooms as needed
* Pour the liquid through a drip coffee filter.  That's probably excessive, but the goal is
  to not eat the dirty sediment.   Use the filtered mushroom juice for stock or cooking.
